    "We have some *data*  $\\mathcal{D}$ consisting of $m$ *examples* $\\{d_i\\}$; each example consisting of a *feature* vector $a_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ and an *observation* $b_i\\in \\mathcal{O}$: $\\mathcal{D} = \\{[a_i,b_i]\\}_{i=1..m}$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of *supervised learning* is to construct a predictor for the observations when given feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach is based on *linear models* which are based on finding a *parameter* $x$ such that the real number $\\langle a_i , x \\rangle$ is used to predict the value of the observation through a *predictor function* $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathcal{O}$: $g(\\langle a_i , x \\rangle)$ is the predicted value from $a_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find such a parameter, we use the available data and a *loss* $\\ell$ that penalizes the error made between the predicted $g(\\langle a_i , x \\rangle)$ and observed $b_i$ values. For each example $i$, the corresponding error function for a parameter $x$ is $f_i(x) =   \\ell( g(\\langle a_i , x \\rangle) ; b_i )$. Using the whole data, the parameter that minimizes the total error is the solution of the minimization problem\n",
    "$$ \\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(x) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m  \\ell( g(\\langle a_i , x \\rangle) ; b_i ). $$\n",

    "### Binary Classification with Logisitic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setup, the observations are binary: $\\mathcal{O} = \\{-1 , +1 \\}$, and the *Logistic loss* is used to form the following optimization problem\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d } f(x) := \\frac{1}{m}  \\sum_{i=1}^m  \\log( 1+\\exp(-b_i \\langle a_i,x \\rangle) ).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",

    "$$ p_1(a) = \\mathbb{P}[d\\in \\text{ class }  +1] = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\langle a;x^\\star \\rangle)} $$\n",
    "Thus, from $a$, if $p_1(a)$ is close to $1$, one can decide that $d$ belongs to class $1$; and the opposite decision if $p(a)$ is close to $0$. Between the two, the appreciation is left to the data scientist depending on the application.\n"
